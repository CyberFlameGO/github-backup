After using github-backup recently with my account username and password (to avoid the limits for anonymous users), I got the mails below from GitHub about password authentication being deprecated. It would be nice to be able to continue to authenticate to get the higher API usage limits.

The latest GitHub blog post about this issue is available [here](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/).

In it they say that they will disable password authentication in November 2020.

The first email I got:

> Subject:	[GitHub] Deprecation Notice

> Hi @pabs3,

> You recently used a password to access an endpoint through the GitHub API using github.hs/0.7.4. We will deprecate basic authentication using password to this endpoint soon:

> We recommend using a personal access token (PAT) with the appropriate scope to access this endpoint instead. Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens for more information.
