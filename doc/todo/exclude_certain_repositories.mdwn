I'd like to suggest a configuration option be added to github-backup to allow for the exclusion of certain repositories. https://github.com/githubschool/open-enrollment-classes-introduction-to-github includes hundreds of forks/branches, and I'd rather not have them downloaded when running "github-backup tomhoover". At one time, I contributed to https://github.com/githubschool/open-enrollment-classes-introduction-to-github; however, it is neither "watched" nor "starred" at this time.
