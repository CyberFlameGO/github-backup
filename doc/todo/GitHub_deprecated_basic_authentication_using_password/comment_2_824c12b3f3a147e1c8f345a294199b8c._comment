I have switched to the GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN variable and the issue has stopped occurring. I hadn't noticed the variable in the manual page, sorry for the noise. I guess the only thing to do now for this issue is to deprecate and remove support for the GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_PASSWORD environment variables, which seem to be checked by the github-backup codebase rather than the GitHub API Haskell codebase.
