Running github-backup in a fresh clone of a repo for the first time, all
the top-level API requests fail. It doesn't say why in that case, but I
think this is a similar case that sheds light on it:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp> github-backup joeyh
	github-backup: Failed to query github for repos:
	....
	(StatusCodeException (Response {responseStatus = Status {statusCode = 403, statusMessage = "rate limit exceeded"}

Setting `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` before running it probably avoids the problem,
but I've not tried it. 

This is apparently the API rate limit blocking the first request. It used
to be that a few hundred or thousand requests were allowed. I don't know
if this has changed intentionally or what. --[[Joey]]
