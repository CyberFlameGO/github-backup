I am having trouble running github-backup under tor. A normal run works like this:

    $ github-backup --no-forks anarcat
    New repository: alabaster
    Clonage dans 'alabaster'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 13, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (13/13), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.
    remote: Total 1572 (delta 2), reused 11 (delta 2), pack-reused 1559
    Réception d'objets: 100% (1572/1572), 508.50 KiB | 2.12 MiB/s, fait.
    Résolution des deltas: 100% (929/929), fait.
    [...]

But running under tor (with [torsocks](https://github.com/dgoulet/torsocks)) hangs forever:

    $ torsocks github-backup --no-forks anarcat
    [blank, hangs forever]

`strace` shows the process is looping over this:

    recvfrom(3, "", 2, 0, NULL, NULL)       = 0
    select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL)        = 1 (in [3])

file descriptor `3` is this, according to lsof:

    github-ba 18134 anarcat    3u  IPv4 162905      0t0     TCP localhost:35828->localhost:9050 (CLOSE_WAIT)

... that's the local SOCKS connexion over to the tor daemon that
`torsocks` reroutes the traffic to, with `LD_PRELOAD`, which I suspect
is playing badly with the Haskell stack behind `github-backup`.

So I understand this might be a compatibility issue - maybe the best
would be to add SOCKS proxy support to github-backup? Not sure how
best to solve this... --[[anarcat]]
