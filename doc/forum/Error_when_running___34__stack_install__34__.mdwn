When I run "stack install", I get the following message:

```
Unable to parse cabal file: NoParse "build-tools" 91
```

I'm not really familiar with Haskell, and I didn't find anything by searching DuckDuckGo for the error message.
Any ideas how I can fix this?

Update:
I used `sudo apt-get install github-backup` and it installed with no problems. :)
