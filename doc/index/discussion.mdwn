Hi,

is it possible to include submodules in a repo-backup? I am trying to backup the repo supercollider, which makes heavy use of submodules.

A second though: I backup an entire oranization with --no-forks, but somehow this doesn't work as expected. For some of the repos attempts are still made to backup forks too?

Thanks
Rainer
