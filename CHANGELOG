  * Increase base bounds to 4.8 to get mapM_ etc that works on Vector.
  * Recommended build method is now to use stack, for more reliable builds.
  * Explicitly list modules and other files in github-backup.cabal.
  * The hackage .tar.gz now omits the debian directory and may omit other
    source files in the future; the purpose of that tarball is to make
    stack/cabal install work, not to be a complete source distribution.
    Use git repository to get complete source.

    with git-annex.

    hardening options. Although their benefit to a largely haskell program
    is unknown.
