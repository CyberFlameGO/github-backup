.SH NAME
github-backup \- backs up data from GitHub
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B github-backup [\fIusername\fP|\fIorganization\fP ...] [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I github-backup
is a simple tool you run in a git repository you cloned from
GitHub. It backs up everything GitHub publishes about the repository,
including other branches, tags, forks, issues, comments, wikis,
milestones, pull requests, and watchers.
.PP
Alternately, if you pass it the username of a GitHub user, it will check
out, and back up, all that user's repositories, as well as all the
repositories that user is watching. (Also works to pass
the name of an organization using GitHub.)
.PP
By default it runs without logging in to GitHub. To log in, set
the GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_PASSWORD environment variables. Or, set
GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN to an oath or personal access token.
However note that logging in only works around API rate limiting; it
does not allow private repositories to be downloaded.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.IP --exclude=username/repository
When backing up a user or an organization, this can be used to exclude
bacup of a particular repository belonging to the user or organization.
This option can be specified any number of time to exclude more than one
repository.
.PP
.IP --no-forks
Avoid backing up a repository's forks.
